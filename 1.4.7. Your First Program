    PROFESSOR FARHAD KAMANGAR: Welcome back.
    
    In this lesson I will show you how to go over
    the example algorithm that was discussed in a previous lesson
    and converted to a program.

    Let's just start by the example algorithm
    that we talked about last time.

    Recall that the algorithm was about converting temperature
    from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

    Step 1 of the algorithm was to get the input temperature in Celsius.

    Imagine that the input temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.

    In step 2, we're going to get the input temperature
    and multiply it by 9 In step 3, we divide the result of step 2
    by 5, which is 180 divided by 5.

    And in step 4, we're going to add 32 to the result. Now 180 divided by 5 is 36,
    and we are going to add 32 to it.

    And then, in the last step, we are going to show the result of step 4, which
    in this case would be 68.

    1. 20
    2. 20 * 9
    3. 180 / 5
    4. 36 + 32 (68)


    Now imagine that each step of the algorithm
    has to be performed by a different person.

    And these people cannot talk to each other,
    and the only way they can communicate is through a piece of paper.
    
    So person 1 gets the input temperature.

    In this case, let's imagine it is 20.

    And then, it's supposed to pass it to person number 2,
    so it can be multiplied by 9.

    In order to do so, person 1 goes and gets a scratch paper,
    writes the value of 20.

    However, to pass this to person number 2, we need to give it a name,
    so we can be fair to it.

    So let's imagine we give it the name, like A. A is not a particular name.

    You can call it anything else that you want.

    It's just a name which is given to 20.

    So A is associated with 20.

    A is a name, and 20 is the value of it.

    And in computer programming, we write it as A equal sign 20.

    A = 20

    I should emphasize that this statement does not mean that A is equal 20.

    It simply means that A is an identifier, which
    is associated with the value of 20.

    In technical term, we call A an identifier.

    Now we ask person 2 to go into the scratch paper
    and get the value, which is associated with the identifier A
    and multiply it times 9.


    And of course, the result is 180.

    In order to refer to this value, we should give it a name.

    Let's give it the name B-- again, B's not a particular name.

    I could have called it anything.

    This is just for simplicity, I called it B. B is associated with 180.

    The statement that we are going to write is B equal sign, A times 9.
    Let's look at this statement a little closer.

    B = A * 9

    What this statement says to the person 2, or to the computer,
    is to calculate the right side of the equal sign.

    To do so, you have to go get the value, which is associated with identifier A
    and multiply it times 9.

    Then, put the resulting value in the scratch paper
    and call it B. That's all there is.
    Again, B is not equal 280.


    It's only associated with it.
    
    Now person 3 needs to get the result of step 2 and divide it by 5.
    
    And this is how you would say it.

    This statement says to the person 3 that go to the scratch paper.

    Get the value, which is associated with identifier B. Divide it by 5.

    And then, put the result into their scratch paper
    and associate it with another identifier,
    in this case C. 

    C = B / 5

    With the same token, person 4 is
    supposed to get the result of step 3 and add 32 to it,
    and this is how we'll say it.

    D = C + 32

    Last, person 5 is supposed to show the result of step 4.
    And this is how we say it.
    Show their value of D. Basically, in computer programming
    this is how we'll say it.
    It says, "Print the value, which is associated with the identifier D."

    print(D)

    Again, I should emphasize that A, B, C, and D
    are identifiers, which are associated with the numerical values of 20,
    180, 36, and 68.

    At this point you may ask, what does all of this
    have to do with Python and programming?

    This is a very good question.

    Think of the persons, which are involved in this algorithm,
    as the brain of a computer, which is called the CPU.


    Example of an Algorithm

    A Python program to convert temparature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:


    								Program 				Memory
    							-----------------		-----------------
    							| A = 20		|		|   ...			|
    							|---------------|		|---------------|
		-----------------		| B = A * 9		|		|   20			|
		|				|		|---------------|		|---------------|
		|	Central		|		| C = B / 5		|		|	180			|
		|	Processing	|		|---------------|		|---------------|
		|	Unit		| <--->	| D = C + 32	| <--->	|	36			|
		|	 - CPU -	|		|---------------|		|---------------|
		|				|		| print(D)		|		|	68			|
		|				|		-----------------		|---------------|			
		-----------------								|   ---			|
														-----------------



    Also, remember that the definition of a program
    is a set of instructions given to a computer.

    Think of instructions, which are given to each person,
    as one line of a program.

    So in this case, the set of all the five instructions constitute a program.

    Also, think of this scratch paper as the memory of the computer,
    and each of the locations, which hold the value, as a variable.

    So, congratulations.

    You actually wrote your first program by converting an algorithm
    into a Python program.
