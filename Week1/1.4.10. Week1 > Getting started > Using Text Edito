An Example:

Imagine that we want to write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Here is our algorithm:

1. Assign a value to the Height variable.

2. Assign a value to the Width variable.

3. Calculate the area -> (Height * Width).

4. Calculate the perimeter -> (Height + Width) *2.

Now open your text editor and make this algorithm to a program.



Code

my_program_1.py

Height_of_rectangle = 20
Width_of_rectangle = 15
area = Height_of_rectangle * Width_of_rectangle
perimeter = (Height_of_rectangle * Width_of_rectangle)* 2

print("area of the rectangle is: ", area)
print("perimeter of the rectangle is: ", perimeter)


Result

area of the rectangle is:  300
perimeter of the rectangle is:  600
