    FARHAD KAMANGAR: Welcome back.

    The previous lesson was about IDLE and Python shell.

    And I'm sure you are interested to use the Python IDLE and write a program.

    But before you do so, you should know what is a program
    and what is an algorithm and what is the difference between them.

    So let's see what is algorithm?
    In simple terms, an algorithm is a description of how to solve a problem.

    Another definition would be an algorithm is a step by step recipe
    off how to perform a task.

    You should understand that algorithms can be written and analyzed
    in any language.

    For example, when you are following a cookbook,
    you're actually following an algorithm in English language.

    We can also write an algorithm by mathematical equations,
    or you can write an algorithm using a computer language.

    Note that there are also different algorithms to solve the same problem.

    So if you get the same problem to two different people,
    they may follow different steps and obviously they're
    following two different algorithms.

    Let's have an example of an algorithm.

    Let's assume we would like to write an algorithm to convert temperatures
    from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

    The first step of such an algorithm would be, of course,
    to get the input Celsius.

    When I say get the input, you can ask a person,
    what is the temperature in Celsius, or you can
    ask a user to type it in a keyboard.

    The next step is to multiply the input temperature by 9.

    Then you will divide the results of the step two by 5.

    The next step is to add 32 to the result of step three.

    And last you show the result. And this is a example of a five step algorithm
    to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

    Now what is the difference between an algorithm and a programmer?

    Again, an algorithm is a description of how to solve a problem,
    while a program is an implementation of an algorithm in a specific programming
    language, or you can say program is a sequence of instruction to a computer.

    So you can take an algorithm and write a program for it in Python language,
    or you can take the same algorithm and write a program for it
    in C language, or Java language, or any other computer language that you know.

    Please make sure that you understand that algorithms
    can be written and analyzed independent of a programming language.

    So algorithm is the description of how to solve a program.

    Program is to implement that description into a particular language.

    There's a difference between an algorithm, which
    is written for humans to a follow versus an algorithm, which is we tend
    to be converted to a computer program.

    Humans are very smart, and they can understand confusing instructions.

    And sometimes they can even correct some of the mistakes.

    However, the computers are very strict, and they require very clear and correct
    instructions.

    And that is what is important in programming language.

    Everything has to be precisely defined.

    Let's talk about the goals of this course.

    The first goal of this course is to learn
    how to break a problem into simpler steps, which is basically an algorithm.

    Practice makes perfect definately applies here.

    The more you try to convert everyday problems into algorithms,
    the better you get in writing a program.

    Now the second goal of this course is to learn
    how to convert an algorithm into a computer program, which
    in this case, of course, is a Python computer program.

    And lastly, we want to learn how to use Python language efficiently
    and solve everyday problems.
