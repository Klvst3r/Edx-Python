About Python



CREATION

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Pythonâ€™s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

WHY THE NAME "PYTHON"?

According to the principal author (Guido van Rossum), he chose the name "Python" because he is a big fan of the British comedy movie - 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'.  *Here is what the author had to say:

* https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/

"Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. ... I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)."

*APPLICATIONS FOR PYTHON

Python is used successfully in thousands of real-world business applications around the world, including many large and mission critical systems. Although the applications for Python are numerous they can be broadly categorized into:

        Web and Internet Development
        Scientific and Numeric Computing
        Education
        Desktop Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
        Software Development

THE ZEN OF PYTHON, BY TIM PETERS

    Beautiful is better than ugly.

    Explicit is better than implicit.

    Simple is better than complex.

    Complex is better than complicated.

    Flat is better than nested.

    Sparse is better than dense.

    Readability counts.

    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

    Although practicality beats purity.

    Errors should never pass silently.

    Unless explicitly silenced.

    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it
